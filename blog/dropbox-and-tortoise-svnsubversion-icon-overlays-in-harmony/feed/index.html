		<description>@LSP, maybe removing the DropboxExt1 registry key will work, why don&#039;t you try it?  

I wrote this article a long time ago, and in fact I don&#039;t even use Windows any more.  I suspect I probably wanted to leave the DropboxExt1 key incase I later changed my mind and want to revert the changes.  So in instead of removing the key I instead deliberate &#039;broke&#039; the link to it.

		<description>I don&#039;t understand the reasoning inside &quot;Optionally: Disable the Dropbox “Green Tick” Overlay&quot;.

If we don&#039;t want Dropbox green tick, why are we told to remove the &quot;DropboxExt1&quot; registry key?  Or change its name to something like zzz&quot;DropboxExt1&quot; to make sure it&#039;s not in the first alphabetical position and thus not used?</description>

		<description>Eugen, there is not; though Explorer can be customized out the wazoo in some places (well beyond anything you would ever want) clearly it falls short here. I don&#039;t know of any third party software that does this for you though it&#039;d be fairly simple to build namespace extensions and realize the same end-result with a configurable front-end. The market probably doesn&#039;t justify the effort, so you&#039;d likely only find freeware with spyware in it. Never looked.

I assume you&#039;re talking about open source here - DropBox has a bit of history taking liberties with the data going onto its&#039; systems. I actually have developed a protective technology that would be a potential fit for such things, if there is enough interest...</description>

		<description>Hey,

thanks for the article.
Do you know, if it is possible, to disable the Dropbox icons only for specific folders?
I would like to disable it for all my Tortoise-Repos in my Dropbox.</description>

		<description>Hey Oliver,

Thanks for the write-up. I had been looking for instructions on disabling the icon overlay for a while. Worked like a charm!</description>
