		<description>Hi Oliver
I read your reviews and you seem to know what you are talking about!
I am going through these same issues right now and have a mix of 2d and 3d sources and devices, and have been recommended an octava 4x4 matrix from avforums. I need to be able to force the system into 3d mode. Will I be better off with the system from hdcable and does that system have forced 3d edid mode? 

Also would you know if I would have to upgrade my onkyo avr to a 3d compatible avr even if i have the matrix?

I would be so grateful for any help you can offer

Kind Regards

		<description>Thanks George, glad I can help.  

Note now that the new &#039;edition&#039; of the HD Anywhere unit is now a 4x4 but with dual UTP (CAT) and HDMI outputs so in a way it is kinda a 4x8. 

Dan from HDCable has kindly swapped my HD Anywhere matrix for a new one (since I was asking about a dual UTP/HDMI before I bought and as a thank you for my good review on AVF).  It arrived this week and is perfect, I am extremely happy!!!!  

So, so happy I have the dual outputs now as well as that was the main reason I originally choose the Octava over the HD Anywhere at the beginning.

Thanks,

		<description>Hi Ollie,

I am just going down this route now and your posts have been a real help to me.  My only difference is that I will be looking for a 4x8 matrix, I was looking the Octava but they are still not released yet, luckly I saw your stuff on AVF and it has given me confidence on the GrandBeing.

Thanks Dude!</description>

		<description>Hi Garry, 

My experience of the HD Anywhere so far has been excellent, everything is working without problem. I have the CAT6 matrix. Unfortunately I don&#039;t own a 3D tv so I haven&#039;t tried/aren&#039;t able to test any 3D content.

Thanks, Ollie</description>

		<description>Hi Oliver,

How is your experience with the HD Anywhere box?
Is it HDMI or Cat?
Have you tried it yet with a 3D disk?

Thanks Oliver,
Garry.</description>
